Fast Searching MPD Client

If you dont have MPD installed and running it wont work 

I made this because I wanted a FAST way to search for and play music, and none of the other clients
I've tried did this well. Most of them involve either navigating through menus or typing out names
of artist/albums/titles with no indication of whether you mispelled something. This can be thought
of as a mpc with autocomplete but only for adding and playing songs.

Also I wanted to start learning rust and this was a good intro project.

running:
 install rust and cargo

 $cargo run

launch it then type (dont include *):
*space -> any attr
*a -> artist
*A -> album artist
*b -> album
*t -> title
*T -> track no (untested)
*d -> disc no (untested)

then type what you want to search followed by enter
then either hit enter again to add the songs and start playing them or continue to refine your search
