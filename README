Fast Searching MPD Client

If you dont have MPD installed and running it wont work (duh!)

I made this because i wanted a FAST way to search for and play music, mpc/nmpc/nmpcpp take to long because:
mpc - you have to spend so much time typing the args, no instant feedback if you mispell something (Dave Brubeck should be spelled Dave Brubek, fuck that guy)
nmpc[pp] - you have to navigate, cant filter as fast
Also i watned to learn rust

running:
 install rust and cargo

 $cargo run

launch it then type (dont include *):
*space -> any attr
*a -> artist
*A -> album artist
*b -> album
*t -> title
*T -> track no (untested)
*d -> disc no (untested)

then type what you want to search followed by enter
then either hit enter again to add the songs and start playing them or continue to refine your search

first project in rust. WOOOO

Things that are broken:
 - Backspace (dont even try)
 - There was something else but i forgot

 Its 2AM. Goog night!
